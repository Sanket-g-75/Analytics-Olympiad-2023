# Customer Loan Default Classifier

## Problem Statement
In today's financial landscape, an accurate prediction of customer loan default can reduce the risk and maintain a healthy lending portfolio. Challenge is to develop a Machine Learning model to determine the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan

## Project Steps
### EDA
Explored all the features of the dataset which included features like Payment History, Previous Default History
### Data Preprocessing
Reduced some of the features using Principal Component Analysis so as to reduce the model complexity and to avoid bias of certain features in the model
### Model
Implemented models like Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier
### Results
Model achieved an accuracy of 0.99989 and the results helped me to achieve a place in Top 50 among 1000+ participants
